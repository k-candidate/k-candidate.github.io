**Hi, I'm k-candidate**

Jack of all trades in Cloud Engineering, On-Prem, SRE, DevSecOps, and FinOps.

**My Journey**

{% assign current_year = 'now' | date: "%Y" %}
{% assign years_of_experience = current_year | minus: 2017 %}
{{years_of_experience}} years across IT support, operations, and engineering.

Over this time, I’ve focused on designing reliable systems, improving developer experience, and strengthening delivery pipelines. I enable teams by:
- Designing self-service tools that empower developers and researchers.
- Implementing infrastructure and configuration as code at scale using modular patterns.
- Building CI/CD orchestration and establishing golden paths for streamlined delivery.
- Embedding automated governance and compliance by design, while finding the right balance for innovation and autonomy.
- Integrating observability as a core part of delivery workflows, not an afterthought.
- Promoting a security-by-design mindset rather than bolt-on security.
- Driving automation using Bash and Python to remove repetitive tasks.
- Optimizing costs through FinOps practices.

**Welcome to my personal blog**

This blog captures my technical notes, key learnings, and experiments. My goal is to share insights that help others solve practical engineering challenges.
