Welcome to my personal blog.

{% assign current_year = 'now' | date: "%Y" %}
{% assign years_of_experience = current_year | minus: 2017 %}
I am a Site Reliability Engineer working with DevSecFinOps practices and AWS, with {{years_of_experience}} years of professional experience in the technology sector.

I mainly use this blog as a place to store my personal notes, technical learnings, and experiments. I hope you find something here that is useful for your own work.
