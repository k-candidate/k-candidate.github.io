You have made a Python package, and you came up with a name, but when you check in PyPI you find out that it is taken.  

If the project is abandoned, or invalid (name squatting for example), there's the possibility to take over it via a name transfer request.

Check out [PEP 541](https://peps.python.org/pep-0541/).
