title: "EU Cyber Resilience Act"

My notes:
- Key provisions take effect in June 2026, with full enforcement in December 2027.

- Regulates PDEs (Products with Digital Elements).
- The use of standards is voluntary, but applying standards can provide evidence that the legal requirements are met. In some cases complying with a standard provides a presumption of conformity. 
- Most software falls under the “Default” classification.
- “Critical” software has the strictest conformity assessment procedure options.

- An organization releasing OSS and directly monetizing it is considered a manufacturer even though they’re involved in developing open source software (OSS)
- OSS steward’s responsibilities:
  - Report on actively exploited vulnerabilities & severe incidents
  - Cooperate with the market surveillance authorities to mitigate risks
  - Put in place and document a cybersecurity policy that fosters development of a secure PDE, handles vulnerabilities, and fosters voluntary reporting of vulnerabilities
- Manufacturer responsibilities:
  -  Design, develop & produce per essential cybersecurity requirements in Annex I Part I 
  - Assess cybersecurity risks and apply that information throughout the product lifecycle 
  - Exercise due diligence when integrating third party components including open source software 
  - Assess conformity with CRA requirements 
  - Ensure the PDE has no known exploitable vulnerabilities 
- Market surveillance authority: the organization designated by a member state government to ensure products comply with the CRA legislation and protect the public interest.
- Requirements for PDEs:
  - PDEs must protect confidentiality of data. 
  - PDEs must protect the integrity of data, programs, and configuration data against unauthorized modifications, including unauthorized deletions.
  - PDEs must protect availability of essential and basic functions, including providing measures against denial-of-service attacks.
- PDEs must NOT have “known exploitable vulnerabilities”

- More manufacturer responsibilities:
  - Security updates must be provided free of charge. 
  - Information for users must include the Internet address for the EU declaration of conformity. 
  - Information for users must include a point of contact for reporting vulnerabilities and coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy. 
  - When a manufacturer learns of a severe incident or an actively exploited vulnerability in PDE it manufactures, it must notify the designated CSIRT & ENISA, and impacted users in a timely manner
- All of these may notify a designated CSIRT or ENISA about a vulnerability, cyber threat, or incident involving a given PDE:
  - User of PDE
  - Potential user of PDE
  - Security researcher who has discovered a vulnerability
  - Competing manufacturer
- Conformity assessment:
  - Software in the “default” category may undergo internal control (aka self-assessment)
  - Critical software that is closed source cannot use internal control (aka self-assessment) for conformity assessment
  - Critical software that is OSS can use internal control (aka self-assessment) but must also meet some additional criteria
  - Manufacturers can release unfinished software without a full CRA conformity assessment, but it must have a risk assessment and comply to the extent possible with CRA.
  - It’s important to perform a compliance assessment before attaching a CE mark (“conformité européenne") to a PDE. 
  - In some cases, even if PDE complies with the CRA, actions can be required if there is a significant cybersecurity risk and risks to certain other areas.
