`tox` aims to automate and standardize testing in Python.

`tox` is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool you can use for:
- checking that your package installs correctly with different Python versions and interpreters
- running your tests in each of the environments, configuring your test tool of choice
- acting as a frontend to Continuous Integration servers, greatly reducing boilerplate and merging CI and shell-based testing.

My objective here is to make sure that when I make changes to the code via a PR, tests run automatically to confirm that the code works with different versions of Python that I am interested in maintaining compatibility with.

I am using `tox` with `uv` via `tox-uv`, and with GHA via `tox-gh`.

## Implementation

Done here: [https://github.com/k-candidate/selenium-book-search-slack-alerts/pull/9](https://github.com/k-candidate/selenium-book-search-slack-alerts/pull/9)

To test with tox locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/k-candidate/selenium-book-search-slack-alerts
cd selenium-book-search-slack-alerts

# Install tox outside of venv
uv tool install tox --with tox-uv

# To run just the unit tests
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest

# To run tox we have to be outside the venv
deactivate
uvx tox
```
