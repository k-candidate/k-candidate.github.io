I have recently read William Strunk’s little book _The Elements of Style_.

It is very short, but dense.

One cannot internalize all the rules and principles on the first read. Hence, I have decided to read it once a year to acquire more good habits as time passes.

I think that this book is relevant for two reasons:
- English is currently the lingua franca of business and science in our time.
- Human language is gradually gaining more importance in programming, i.e. prompt engineering. It’s reasonable to expect that the intersection between human language skills (humanities) and technical fields (STEM) will continue to grow.
