The "knowledge" embedded in LLMs includes only events or information made public up to their training cutoff date (see [https://github.com/HaoooWang/llm-knowledge-cutoff-dates](https://github.com/HaoooWang/llm-knowledge-cutoff-dates)).

This means that any releases of libraries or updates published after that date are not included in the LLM's inherent knowledge.

The Context7 MCP ([https://context7.com/](https://context7.com/)) addresses this limitation by providing real-time access to always up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples.
